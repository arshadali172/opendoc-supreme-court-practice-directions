# PART XXIII: MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS

158\. Compliance with protocol

# 158\. Compliance with protocol

(1) With effect from 1 July 2017, parties in medical negligence claims
are to comply with the High Court Protocol for Medical Negligence Cases
at Appendix J of these Practice Directions. A breach by one party will
not exempt the other parties in the claim from following the protocol
insofar as they are able to do so.

(2) In exercising its discretion as to costs, the Court will consider
compliance with the protocol. If non-compliance with the protocol has
led to unnecessary costs, the Court may make the following orders:

(a) an order disallowing a defaulting party his costs, or some part of
his costs, even if he succeeds;

(b) an order that the defaulting party pay the other party or parties
their costs of the proceedings, or part of those costs; and

(c) an order that the defaulting party pay those costs on an indemnity
basis.

(3) The Court will consider compliance with the protocol in exercising
its discretion when deciding the amount of interest payable and may make
the following orders:

(a) an order awarding a successful party who has complied with the
protocol interest from <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â </span>a date
earlier than the date from which he would otherwise have been entitled
to obtain interest; and

(b) an order depriving a successful party who has not complied with the
protocol of interest in respect of such period as may be specified.
